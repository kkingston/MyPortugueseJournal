# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# response = RestClient.get('https://dictapi.lexicala.com/search?source=global&language=pt')
# data = JSON.parse(response)
# words = data["results"]  

# words.each do |word|
#   binding.pry 
#   Word.create!(
#     word: word["name"],
#     pos: word["pos"],
#     definition: word["definition"])
#   end
